# Figure Isobars and Isopleths
To obtain the figure, first run =solwcad= to produce the dataset for
 isobars and isopleths: compile the relevant files by typing
 
 ```
 make
 ```
 
 Pressure and volatile compositions are set in
 [UserSolwcad](UserSolwcad.cpp). Data are now stored in
 [solwcadResultsIsopleth.out](solwcadResultsIsopleth.out). The figure
 is produced by [figIsobarsIsoleths.m](figIsobarsIsoleths.m).
